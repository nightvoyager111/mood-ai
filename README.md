### Why This Exists (aka why I built this)
I used every mood tracker out there. They'd dutifully record my "3/10" days, then shrug when burnout inevitably kicks in.

### What It Actually Does
A dual-function tool combining:
- **Smart Mood and Behaviour Tracking** (auto-detects meltdown triggers)
- **AI-powered Chat** (no toxic positivity)
